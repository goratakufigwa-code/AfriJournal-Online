                <h3>Why Botswana’s Youth Deserve a Bigger Voice in National Conversations</h3>
                <p><strong>By AfriJournal Editorial Team</strong></p>
                <p>Despite being the backbone of the country, young people in Botswana rarely have a voice in the most crucial discussions that take place in the country. Young people are far too frequently viewed as passive observers in issues that directly affect their future, even though they make up the majority of the population. There must be an end to this silence.</p>
                <p>Every national decision has an immediate impact on young Batswana, from mental health and unemployment to innovation and governance. However, young people are rarely present at the table when policies are being discussed or put into action. Their opinions are disregarded, their suggestions are not sufficiently supported, and their annoyances are misinterpreted. If a country keeps its most creative and active citizens out of the conversation, it will never advance.</p>
                <p>Youth unemployment remains a major issue in Botswana.  Each year, thousands of capable graduates struggle to find work, and some turn to self-employment or unofficial work with little help from the government.  Involving young people in public policy debates could lead to more innovative, forward-thinking, and workable solutions.  They live the reality that decision-makers sometimes simply read about in reports, after all.</p>
                <p>The younger generation is full of ideas and initiative.  In Botswana, young people are leading small businesses, internet startups, and community projects.  They are transforming art, music, and technology. However, without areas for decision-making, their potential is constrained.  The public, business, and civil society sectors must consciously create more platforms where the views of young people are acknowledged, appreciated, and taken into account.</p>
                <p>Democracy is strengthened when young people are given the opportunity to engage in governance. Young people are more inclined to vote, volunteer, and take on leadership roles in their communities when they believe their opinions count. However, political apathy, which is a danger to any democracy, increases when people feel ignored.</p>
                <p>The fact is straightforward: Botswana cannot create the future without incorporating its heirs. Giving young people a bigger say in national discussions is a necessity, not a charity. In a world that is changing, Botswana will remain relevant thanks to their ideas, enthusiasm, and digital insight. In addition to listening to them, decision-makers must have enough faith in them to delegate some of the nation-building duties to them.</p>

                <h3>Media Responsibility in the Age of Social Networks</h3>
                
                <p><strong>By Gorata Bame Kufigwa</strong></p>
                <p>With social media taking its place as the primary information source, traditional journalism now faces the challenge of maintaining its credibility in a rapidly changing digital landscape. Platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) have made it more difficult to discern between objective reporting and subjective opinion, making everyone a potential news source.</p>
                <p>In this new world, newsrooms must strike a balance between speed and accuracy.  The desire to be the first to post usually leads to sensational headlines and inaccurate information that erodes public trust. Journalists and editors must therefore implement stringent fact-checking protocols and ensure that each narrative complies with the principles of justice and truth.</p>
                <p>Transparency is another crucial component of ethical reporting.  Audiences are interested in the information's sources and methods of verification.  Credibility is more likely to be maintained by publications who interact with readers online and publicly correct mistakes. Journalists' personal use of social media is another aspect of media responsibility.  The public's perception of a reporter's objectivity may be influenced by their online persona.  To keep personal beliefs apart from professional reporting, ethical standards need to be strengthened.</p>
                <p>As the digital age continues to evolve, journalism must not lose its moral compass. Upholding integrity, accountability, and truth will remain the foundation upon which the public’s trust in media stands.</p>
