  <p>Following a strategic discussion with Jacob Kelebeng, Minister of Sport and Arts, the Botswana Cricket Association (BCA) has obtained government backing to address important development issues, such as young participation and infrastructure shortages.</p>
  <p>The purpose of the courtesy call, which was attended by Ms. Boineelo Hardy, Deputy Permanent Secretary for Arts, and Vice Chairperson Sumod Damodar of the BCA, was to enhance cricket's development routes and fill important infrastructural shortages.Since 2005, the BCA, which was established in 1983, has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The association has implemented effective grassroots programs over the years, but the suspension of school sports has recently hampered these efforts. In order to bring cricket back to the school level and ensure its survival for the coming generation, Damodar underlined that the BCA is currently looking to work with educators.</P>
  <p>The lack of cricket grounds in the nation was one of the primary topics of discussion. In order to expand infrastructure, the BCA indicated interest in purchasing the land behind its current facilities, pointing out that better grounds would enable Botswana to host international competitions. If the facilities are available, nations like Brazil, Samoa, and Malaysia have already expressed interest in competing in Botswana in 2026.Although Botswana's senior men's and women's teams have had significant success, junior team development is still difficult. In spite of this, the ICC still provides the BCA with substantial support, including a $390,000 yearly grant to support development initiatives</p>
   <p>The BCA's suggestions will be incorporated into the newly draughted Sport and Recreation Act, Minister Kelebeng said, welcoming their input. Additionally, he assured the association that the Department of Sport would support cricket in achieving its development objectives and reiterated government plans to bring school sports back to life.The meeting is seen as a significant step toward ensuring the long-term growth of cricket in Botswana, with a focus on expanding access, building infrastructure, and positioning the country as a competitive player on the international stage.</p>
