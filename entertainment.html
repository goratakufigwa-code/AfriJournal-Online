                    The Dejavu Appreciation Party 3.0 was almost wrecked by Kelvin Momo's absence, but Ati's passion and Casper's  flare saved the evening in a way never be forgotten.'The night was saved by Ati and Casper, who did more than just perform.

                   Fans were shocked when South African Amapiano singer Kelvin Momo did not perform as the main act at the Dejavu Appreciation Party 3.0, which took place on July 22 at Game City Parkade.  But with their incredible performances that threw the audience into a frenzy, two musical legends Ati from Botswana and Cassper Nyovest from South Africa rescued the evening from a dismal finale.  The event turned into a celebration of talent, tenacity and the unwavering party spirit of Botswana's music enthusiasts in spite of the setback.
                </p>
                <p>An official statement from Kelvin Momo and Tsquared Production cited “unforeseen circumstances” as the reason for the no show. “This was not an easy decision,” the statement read. “But it comes after much thought and consideration. Kelvin will perform at a show on the 28th of August at DEJA VU.” The apology extended to the people of Botswana and DJ Kuchi, one of the event’s lead organisers. Though disappointed, fans were reassured that their tickets would still be valid for the rescheduled event and the party rolled on with optimism and anticipation for August.</p>
                <p>Ati instantly brought the atmosphere back to life when she took the stage first.  His stirring performance immediately saved the audience from the verge of disenchantment by bringing soul, fire, and unrivalled charisma into the event.  Everyone was reminded of why he is still one of Botswana's most beloved entertainers by his commanding stage presence and close relationship with the crowd.  Ati established the tone for a night that would only get more dramatic and emotional, and the clapping got louder as the performance picked up steam.</p>
                <p>The early tension was reduced by the calming, ambient set of South African vocalist Babalwa M.  Her soothing sounds and silky Amapiano vocals added a new kind of enchantment, demonstrating to the audience that there were still surprises to be discovered throughout the evening.  Zee Nxumalo surprised the audience by making an unexpected appearance just when it looked like the performances couldn't be any more surprising.  With fierce vocals and a stunning stage presence, the budding Amapiano sensation upped the ante, sending audiences into a dancing frenzy that suggested something even bigger was still to come.</p>
                <p>The highlight of the evening was when Cassper Nyovest arrived in Gaborone in time for the main event.  The singer, who is well-known for his iconic stage performances and number-one records, raised the stakes with a breathtaking performance.  Fans have every cause to forget Momo's absence thanks to Cassper's amazing performance of both old and contemporary favourites.  His very presence served as a reminder of the power of spectacle and star draw, transforming an otherwise doomed event into a success.</p>
                <p>The turnout was massive, the fashion bold, and the dancing relentless. Game City Parkade pulsed with life as fans turned what began as a near-cancellation into one of the most vibrant nights of the year. Organizers confirmed that all tickets remain valid for Momo’s August 28th performance and pledged an even grander experience. Still, many agreed: what Ati and Cassper Nyovest did that night can’t be repeated. They didn’t just show up they saved the show.</p>

                <h3>Summer Xplosion 2025: A Wildand Impolite Evening</h3>
                <p><strong>By AfriJournal Team</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Botswana’s premier music festival, Summer Xplosion 2025, was supposed to be a revitalising event, but for many attendees, it turned out to be a chaotic and disappointing evening. The event was marred by perceived disregard for local talent and several organisational flaws, despite promises of a better experience and top-notch performances.

                </p>
                <p>Long waits at a tiny ticket counter and unclean, dusty entrances were just two of the logistical challenges festival-goers had to deal with. Long lines created a frustrating atmosphere, and poor lighting combined with overgrown grass made it difficult for attendees to reach security checkpoints, raising safety concerns. Dissatisfaction among the crowd was further heightened by a sudden policy change that forbade cooler boxes at the gate and required spectators to buy pricey drinks inside.</p>
                <p>Local performers also felt underappreciated due to the event’s performance management, as their sets were abruptly cut short to make room for foreign acts. This approach, many argued, undermined the efforts of local artists and sent a discouraging message about the value of homegrown talent. Fans expressed frustration after witnessing a local artist’s microphone being turned off mid-performance, an incident that symbolised the disregard for Botswana’s musicians.</p>

                <p>Summer Xplosion 2025 was expected to be one of the most anticipated events of the year. Instead, it has become a cautionary tale of poor event management and a lack of respect for local creatives. The logistical failures and imbalance in artist treatment have left many disappointed. As Botswana’s entertainment sector continues to grow, event organisers must prioritise professionalism, security, and equal opportunities for all artists both local and international.</p>
                <p>Rebuilding public trust after Summer Xplosion 2025 requires a genuine effort to meet audience expectations and treat all performers fairly. The time has come for event planners and promoters to collaborate in creating inclusive platforms that celebrate local talent while maintaining international standards.</p>
